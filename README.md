# cli-demo
Project for Demoing CLI Development using golang

### Use Case

Hi, I am Ram and I am devops professional employed by a pet store which deals with adoption of pets. 
Company has another employee named Shyam who works on store's front desk and deals with adopters. 
This employee is a volunteer who is not so tech savy and has requested an easy way to deal with day to day activities 
like getting pets, add new pets and so on and so forth.

Shyam asked Ram if he can give a very easy to use system to interact with backend database which is maintained by
Pet Adoption community. So Ram decided to give Shyam a very easy to use cli program which he can use to get information
he need easily and efficiently.

## Agenda

In this branch Ram will initialize go project and get dependencies for creating CLI.

He has decided to use following tools:

* [GoLang](https://go.dev/) : Language which Ram will use to create CLI.
* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) : It's an opensource module which provides framework to create CLI's in golang.
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) : It's an opensource module which helps to manage configuration for any go program.
* [osapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen) : Helps to create client/server code based on open api specification.
